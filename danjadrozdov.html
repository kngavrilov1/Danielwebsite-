    <li class="txt">Danja Drozdov is a music project I started in September 2024. 
    This year this has been my main creative focus, and I’m currently working on a full length album. 
    I cannot share much more than that for now, but the background ambience playing is one of its interludes. 
    Hoping to have it finished by the end of this year.</li>
