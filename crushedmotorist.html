    <li class="txt">Crushed Motorist: COMATIZED is a single-player racing game I created in my 6th year of high school. 
    That year I spent most of my time working on this project, and maybe even a bit too much.
This game was an expression of nostalia, combining a story driven experience with retro inspired racing mechanics, 
drawing influence from titles like Need for Speed: High Stakes and the Midnight Tune series.
Its visual style is designed to evoke the PlayStation 1 era, using low-poly graphics and a bitcrushed soundtrack.
This project was the first one that I was honestly proud of and it is what truly sparked my love for developing.</li>
