    <li class="txt">BINAS_ARCHIVES is a web based art exhibition developed collaboratively with one of my closest friends in our fifth year of high school.
It functions like a digital museum where you can navigate through rooms and click on paintings to view them in detail and access information about each piece.
The project includes subtle horror themed easter eggs, so some elements might be unsettling for sensitive viewers.</li>
